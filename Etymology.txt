Sárasvatī is the feminine nominative singular form of the adjective sárasvat (which occurs in the Rigveda[29] as the name of the keeper of the celestial waters), derived from 'sáras' + 'vat', meaning 'having sáras-'. Sanskrit sáras- means 'lake, pond' (cf. the derivative sārasa- 'lake bird = Sarus crane'). Mayrhofer considers unlikely a connection with the root *sar- 'run, flow' but does agree that it could have been a river that connected many lakes due to its abundant volumes of water-flow.[30]

Sarasvatī is considered to be a cognate of Avestan Haraxvatī.[31][32] In the younger Avesta, Haraxvatī is Arachosia, a region described to be rich in rivers, and its Old Persian cognate Harauvati.
